# Wifi-Avalaible
Wifi-Avalaible is a Python script that allows us to connect to a WiFi network through the terminal when using a polybar.
## Dependencies 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip install colorama
```
## Instalations
We move the app.py to a path path to call the script with simply the name.
```
cd Wifi-Avalaible
mv app.py /usr/local/bin/
```

Now we can call it with the name from any directory.
